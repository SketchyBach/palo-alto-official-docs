 Configure a Site Prefix 

 You can configure site prefixes for branch sites, but the preferred method for
 advertising branch reachability is through the use of global scope interfaces and static
 routes. 

 Where Can I Use
 This? What Do I
 Need? 

 Prisma SD-WAN (Managed by Strata Cloud Manager ) 

 Prisma SD-WAN 

 Prisma SD-WAN uses site prefixes to advertise reachability from sites into the SD-WAN fabric.
 Site prefixes allow Prisma SD-WAN data center sites to easily advertise routes and
 reachability to branch sites. This can also be accomplished using globally scoped
 static routes in the data center ION devices, but for simplicity, configuring at the
 site level may be preferred. 

 You can configure site prefixes for branch sites, but
 the preferred method for advertising branch reachability is through the use of
 global scope interfaces and static routes. 

 Configure site prefixes to route traffic for a data center site. 

 Select Configuration Prisma SD-WAN Data Centers <Name of the site> . 

 In the Routing section, under IP
 Prefixes , click Manage IP Prefixes . 

 On the IP Prefixes screen, click Edit Add IP Prefix . You can add IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for prefixes and click
 Save . 

 Enter an IP Prefix and click Save . 

 (Optional) Click View Advertised IP Prefixes to
 view the list of Global IP prefixes and VRF Prefixes
 attached to the site .
